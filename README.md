# wong-nick-portfolio

## Description

The objective for this project is to utilize the HTML and CSS we have learned in class in order to put together a portfolio of all my current projects. 

What I am looking forward to is learning more and practicing the advanced teachings from the course including:
* flexbox
* classes and IDs
* pseudo classes

I believe that by putting together a portfolio of my work, I can also improve my own skills by applying what I have learned in class. 

Here is a screenshot of the website based on my code:

## How to use my projects

Hopefully others can use this project to help improve their own code/structure/styles to create their own unique portfolio. Even without plagiarism, someone can learn how to better apply CSS and HTML to enhance other websites. 

## Credits

This project was made possible by my instructor, Jeslyn who continues to facilitate the learning process and our TAs who assist with any questions we come across.
